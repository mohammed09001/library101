# Library Project Projection Engine — Roadmap of Tasks V1

- **Working Product:** Library
- **Engine:** Library Project Projection Engine
- **Document Type:** Engineering Task Roadmap
- **Version:** V1
- **Date:** 30 August 2026
- **Time:** 11:13 AM
- **Timezone:** Asia/Muscat
- **Status:** Living implementation roadmap
- **Operating Strategy:** Backend-first → Terminal-usable → Agent-tool-usable → Game integration later.
- **Ordered implementation tasks:** 38
- **Architecture Rule:** Build independently, integrate through versioned contracts/events, never through another engine's private store.
- **Execution Rule:** Execution prompts compiled from this roadmap are self-contained; coding agents must not need this roadmap file at runtime.

# Roadmap Doctrine

This roadmap translates the V1 Engine design into implementable repository work. Task numbering expresses dependency order, not calendar estimates. Existing repository code that already satisfies a task must be verified and preserved rather than rebuilt. Every external project listed here is a research input; the implementation agent must inspect current upstream source/docs when the task materially depends on that behavior.

# External Research Baseline

- **notify-rs/notify** — Cross-platform filesystem notifications over OS-specific backends plus polling fallback. Use debounce/file identity/content hashes because filesystem event streams are not a canonical change log.
- **unifiedjs/unified** — Plugin-based parse → syntax tree → transform → compile pipeline across mdast/hast/nlcst ecosystems, with file metadata via vfile. Use a structured Study IR/AST and deterministic renderers.
- **automerge/automerge-repo** — Separates document core from pluggable storage/network adapters and supports local/offline synchronization. V1 Library has a single canonical Local Runtime, so CRDT adoption is benchmark/requirements-gated rather than default.

# Ordered Tasks

# PHASE I — PROJECTION OWNERSHIP AND MANIFEST FOUNDATION

## Task 1: Freeze Projection vs canonical storage boundary

Projection owns project-facing files/views and reverse parsing for explicitly editable types. Deleting/editing generated files must not silently redefine canonical Study/Memory/Context truth.

- Define negative/degraded behavior, persistence/recovery implications, privacy/security boundaries, and observability for this scope.
- Add focused tests plus at least one boundary/failure case able to falsify a false completion claim.

**Research / terminology targets:**
- No mandatory external repository for this Task. Stay repository-first; consult the Engine research baseline or official documentation only if a material implementation question requires it.

**Completion evidence:**
- Focused tests plus repository-native verification demonstrating the behavior and its failure mode.
- Fresh final-state repository evidence must support the Goal; agent prose alone is not proof.

## Task 2: Define ProjectProjection identity and type contract

- Focused tests plus repository-native verification demonstrating the behavior and its failure mode.
- Fresh final-state repository evidence must support the Goal; agent prose alone is not proof.

## Task 37: Build source-deletion/folder-move recovery qualification

Move project, delete generated files/source records, restart runtime and prove stable project identity plus correct regeneration/tombstone behavior.

**Required engineering outcomes:**
- Locate and preserve any existing canonical implementation before adding a new owner.
- Implement the capability through versioned Engine contracts and stable identities.
- Define negative/degraded behavior, persistence/recovery implications, privacy/security boundaries, and observability for this scope.
- Add focused tests plus at least one boundary/failure case able to falsify a false completion claim.

**Research / terminology targets:**
- No mandatory external repository for this Task. Stay repository-first; consult the Engine research baseline or official documentation only if a material implementation question requires it.

**Completion evidence:**
- Focused tests plus repository-native verification demonstrating the behavior and its failure mode.
- Fresh final-state repository evidence must support the Goal; agent prose alone is not proof.

## Task 38: Final Project Projection Engine gate

Prove project files are views, two-way support is explicit/validated, watcher events are reconciled, Sync integration is loop-safe and no game dependency exists.

# Final Definition of Done

Library Project Projection Engine V1 is complete when every ordered Task is either verified as already satisfied or implemented, every Execution Prompt reaches YES, the Engine is usable from the real terminal without the game, cross-engine integration uses only versioned contracts, failure/degraded states are explicit, and final qualification proves the Engine's domain ownership rather than only compilation.
