# Library Study Lineage / Versioning Engine — Roadmap of Tasks V1

- **Working Product:** Library
- **Engine:** Library Study Lineage / Versioning Engine
- **Document Type:** Engineering Task Roadmap
- **Version:** V1
- **Date:** 30 August 2026
- **Time:** 11:13 AM
- **Timezone:** Asia/Muscat
- **Status:** Living implementation roadmap
- **Operating Strategy:** Backend-first → Terminal-usable → Agent-tool-usable → Game integration later.
- **Ordered implementation tasks:** 29
- **Architecture Rule:** Build independently, integrate through versioned contracts/events, never through another engine's private store.
- **Execution Rule:** Execution prompts compiled from this roadmap are self-contained; coding agents must not need this roadmap file at runtime.

# Roadmap Doctrine

This roadmap translates the V1 Engine design into implementable repository work. Task numbering expresses dependency order, not calendar estimates. Existing repository code that already satisfies a task must be verified and preserved rather than rebuilt. Every external project listed here is a research input; the implementation agent must inspect current upstream source/docs when the task materially depends on that behavior.

# External Research Baseline

- **dolthub/dolt** — Git-like commits, diffs, history, branching, blame, and time travel over structured data. Use the model as inspiration for immutable Study lineage rather than adopting Dolt as a mandatory V1 database.
- **GitoxideLabs/gitoxide** — Rust Git implementation exposing fetch, status, blob/tree diff, commit-graph traversal, objects, refs, index, pathspecs and worktree operations. Verify feature stability per crate; CLI binaries are not promised stable scripting interfaces.
- **getzep/graphiti** — Temporal facts with validity windows, episodes as provenance, incremental graph construction, contradiction/supersession history, hybrid retrieval. Treat a graph as a rebuildable projection, not canonical Library truth.

# Ordered Tasks

# PHASE I — LINEAGE IDENTITY AND IMMUTABILITY

# Final Definition of Done

Library Study Lineage / Versioning Engine V1 is complete when every ordered Task is either verified as already satisfied or implemented, every Execution Prompt reaches YES, the Engine is usable from the real terminal without the game, cross-engine integration uses only versioned contracts, failure/degraded states are explicit, and final qualification proves the Engine's domain ownership rather than only compilation.
